# Juce-Otodecks
Developing DJ application called Otodecks

<h2>Introduction</h2>

Developing an DJ application called Otodecks by adding a custom deck control Component with custom graphics and a unique means of deck control, as well as a music library Component that allows users to manage a library of music, search for songs, and load them into decks. The music library should persist between application loads and store its state in a data file. The student is also required to integrate these new Components into a new GUI layout of their own design.


<h2>To run this code: </h2>
1. The Juce application needs to be downloaded from https://juce.com/download/. </br>
2. It appears that the JUCE settings may require configuration, as the path to the application may be directing to an incorrect location, and the same may be true for the path to the application module.
